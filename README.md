## Introduction

[Gosip Bookstore](https://flo-gosip.herokuapp.com/ "visit website") demonstrates the functionalities of an E-commerce website specifically with a **B2C**(Business to Customer) relationship. Buyers can view a list of books within the Bookstore, select an individual book from the list to view its details, choose to add the book to their wishlist for later purchase or decide to add the book to their shopping cart at a certain quantity from where they can proceed to checkout the Item(s) using a secure payment system [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de "visit stripe"). 
Moreover, the Store Administrator also has the possibility of **CRUD**ing book's authors and books in the bookstore from the front end. Overall, the website provides the ability to make a complete online business transaction between the Store Owner and Buyers/Users seamlessly. Gosip Bookstore was built with a Frontend(HTML, CSS, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "visit Bootstrap"),  [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/ "visit Javascript"), [Jquery](https://jquery.com/ "visit Jquery")) and Backend ([Python](https://www.python.org/ "visit Python"),  [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "visit django")) Software with an **Agile** Mindset.
